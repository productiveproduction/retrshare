# About RetroShare
RetroShare is a nostalgic BBS-style web application that enables community members to share computing resources with friends and other trusted users. The interface features a retro green-on-blue terminal aesthetic with blinking cursors, ASCII art, and that classic 90s computing vibe.

## Key Features
1. **Resource Sharing Dashboard**: Monitor CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth being shared and used
1. **Configurable Resource Sharing**: Set how much of your computer's resources to share with others
1. **Community Resource Usage**: Launch applications on community resources with different requirement profiles
1. **Community Hub**: Connect with other users, post messages on the bulletin board, and check the contribution leaderboard
1. **Retro Aesthetics**: Complete with ASCII art, terminal-style interfaces, and animated blinking cursors

## Technical Implementation
The application uses:

* ReactJS framework
* styled-components retro styling (including animations and progress bars)
* zustand state management
* A nostalgic color scheme with bright green text on navy blue backgrounds

## How It Works

1. Users can share a portion of their computer's resources
1. Other community members can use these shared resources to run applications
1. A points system rewards users who share more resources
1. A bulletin board allows for community communication
1. Security settings protect users' shared resources

This implementation is a static conceptual demonstration. In an idealistic scenario, it would need backend services for peer-to-peer connections, resource management, and security protocols.
